# VBAChallenge
The purpose of this script is to analyze stock data in Microsoft Excel. This script can be utilized by copying and pasting the text into Microsoft VBA to act on a workbook of stock data. This script was written to act on a specific Microsoft Excel workbook as an exercise at the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Bootcamp. 

I worked with my peers Kiet Hoang, Mike Pointek, Patrick Dean, Katie Ballinger, Jordan Underwood, Kyle Tener, and Sarah Schilling in developing this VBA script. <br>
I used guidance from https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/stock-analysis.git to develop my code for this VBA script. <br>
I additionally used guidance from https://github.com/cmac18/Analysis-of-Stock-Market-Data.git to develop my code for this VBA script. <br>
I adapted code from the above listed Git repositories to develop my solution.
